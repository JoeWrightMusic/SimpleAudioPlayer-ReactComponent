# SimpleAudioPlayer-ReactComponent

 Simple Audio Player Component following Amy Dutton's (Self Teach Me) Tutorial:
[How to Build a Custom Audio Player in React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqpg1qzJCGQ)

In addition to the video content, an additional function is added to the audio components 'onLoadedMetadata' event listener (as suggested in the pinned comment for the video), and the playbutton resets when the file plays to the end (audioPlayer.current.ended===true).
